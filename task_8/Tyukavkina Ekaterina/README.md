## 8 Queens problem
|Criteria | Ekaterina Tyukavkina | Nguyen Hyu | Zhulin Artem |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ease to change the implementation algorithm | ★★★★☆ <br> It is possible to wrap functions into class methods | ★★★★☆ <br> It is possible to wrap functions into class methods | ★★★★★ <br> It is easy to make functions from class methods|
| Ease to change data representation | ★★★★★ <br> There is a certain function, which represents the output | ★★★☆☆ <br> Need to write the data representation module from scratch. There is only print | ★★★★★  <br> There is a certain function, which represents the output |
| Ease to add additional functions to the modules | ★★★★☆☆ It easy to add new modules because each function does not depend on other functions |  ★★★★☆☆ It easy to add new modules because there is only one functions and it consists of itself and another one | ★★★★★ <br> It is easy to add new methods to classes|
| Performance | ★★★★☆ <br> CPU times: user 19 ms, sys: 1.9 ms, total: 20.9 ms, Wall time: 21.1 ms | ★★★★★ <br> CPU times: user 15.3 ms, sys: 1.66 ms, total: 17 ms, Wall time: 17.2 ms | ★★★★☆ <br> CPU times: user 20.6 ms, sys: 242 μs, total: 20.8 ms, Wall time: 21.3 ms |
| Reuse | ★★★☆☆ <br> Solution is not unique but data representation in quite interesting |  ★★★★☆ <br> Easy to implement plus short and fast |  ★★★★☆ <br> I just like OOP, because it is scalable and easier to comprehend :) |
