## 8 Queens problem
|Criteria | Ekaterina Tyukavkina | Nguyen Hyu | Zhulin Artem |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ease to change the implementation algorithm | ★★★★☆ <br> It is possible to wrap functions into class methods | ★★★★☆ <br> It is possible to wrap functions into class methods | ★★★★★ <br> It is easy to make functions from class methods|
| Ease to change data representation | ★★★★★ <br> There is a certain function, which represents the output | ★★★☆☆ <br> Need to write the data representation module from scratch. There is only print | ★★★★★  <br> There is a certain function, which represents the output |
| Ease to add additional functions to the modules | ★★★★☆ <br> It easy to add new modules because each function does not depend on other functions |  ★★★★☆ <br> It easy to add new modules because there is only one functions and it consists of itself and another one | ★★★★★ <br> It is easy to add new methods to classes |
| Performance | ★★★★☆ <br> CPU times: user 19 ms, sys: 1.9 ms, total: 20.9 ms, Wall time: 21.1 ms | ★★★★★ <br> CPU times: user 15.3 ms, sys: 1.66 ms, total: 17 ms, Wall time: 17.2 ms | ★★★★☆ <br> CPU times: user 20.6 ms, sys: 242 μs, total: 20.8 ms, Wall time: 21.3 ms |
| Reuse | ★★★☆☆ <br> Solution is not unique but data representation is quite interesting |  ★★★★☆ <br> Easy to implement plus short and fast |  ★★★★☆ <br> I just like OOP, because it is scalable and easier to comprehend :) |
## KWIC problem
|Criteria | Ekaterina Tyukavkina | Nguyen Hyu | Zhulin Artem | 
|---|---|---|---|
| Ease to change the implementation algorithm | ★★★★★ <br> Easy, just need to change methods in classes | ★★★★★ <br> Easy, just need to change methods in classes | ★★★★★ <br> Easy, just need to change methods in classes |
| Ease to change data representation | ★★★☆☆ <br> No certain function for data output, only print | ★★★☆☆ <br> Only raw output with print | ★★★★★ <br> Easy to alter output function |
| Ease to add additional functions to the modules | ★★★★★ <br> It is easy to add new methods to classes | ★★★★★ <br> It is easy to add new methods to classes | ★★★★★ <br> It is easy to add new methods to classes |
| Performance | ★★★☆☆ <br> CPU times: user 26.3 ms, sys: 20.5 ms, total: 46.8 ms, Wall time: 4.68 s | ★★★★★ <br> CPU times: user 534 μs, sys: 434 μs, total: 968 μs, Wall time: 1.07 ms | ★★★☆☆ <br> CPU times: user 26.1 ms, sys: 19.2 ms, total: 45.3 ms, Wall time: 4.26 s |
| Reuse | ★★★★☆ <br> Not scalable, I guess| ★★★★★ <br> Very fast (probably because of input absence) | ★★★★☆ <br> Interesting, but hard to comprehend (in my humble opinion)|
