# Task - 7
### Team: ETL-Express

## Description:

```
Solve behavior modeling tasks using UML2. This is a research and self-study activity. You will need to find out about new concepts using the references and links provided.

You will get individual points for studying and explaining new concepts to other students. Prepare a short 5-7 minutes report on the topic. A report shall include a correct solution of the bullet from the task as an example. 

The most elaborate and precise report for each new concept gets the point.

A team gets a project point if it correctly solves all of the tasks and bullets in a chosen category. 

There are a total of eight new concepts in four modeling tasks (one in a bullet). There are three categories. No more than four teams per category. You may coordinate concepts and categories with the other teams. Please, at most two reports on the same concept.

There is an extra Task 3 for activity modeling. Solve it at will.

Results of the task include
- a PDF with solved tasks in the chosen category and rationale for the solution
- a video recording with an explanation of a new concept (if not reported at class)
```
